The first pixel value sets the horizontal offset of the shadow from the text: how far it moves across.
The second pixel value sets the vertical offset of the shadow from the text: how far it moves down.
The third pixel value sets the blur radius of the shadow. A larger value produces a more fuzzy-looking shadow.
The fourth value sets the base color of the shadow. */
